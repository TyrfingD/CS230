Operating Platforms coursework

The design document added to this repository details a game application project for a client called "The Gaming Room". The client presented us with "Draw it or Lose it", a puzzle solving game they already have available for Android devices and tasked us with making that game available for additional platforms. In this design document, I think I did a particularly good job in describing the UML diagram that models the class structure of the software. This diagram also helped me develop the code itself. If feel that the weakest part of this design document is the summary. I had to revise it once, and yet I worry it could use even further revision.

The user's needs are quite simple for this application. They need to be able to play the game, which means I needed to make sure not to break its functionality. They also need to be able to create a player name and join a team, which means the code needed to check for existing names and then authenticate the user's choice. I approached this software design task-by-task, checking through the specific sections of code that were designated with "FIXME" tags. I wasn't able to complete every task though, and if I were required to do something similar again I need to improve my learning techniques. I probably need to get better at finding solutions online to problems I cannot solve on my own.
